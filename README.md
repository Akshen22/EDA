## ðŸ“– Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring and summarizing datasets to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and understand variable relationships.  
This project provides a structured, visually rich approach to performing EDA using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn)** with examples that can run directly in **Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook**.
